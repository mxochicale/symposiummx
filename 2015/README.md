## DRAFT: Quantifying Dexterity in Dance

The use of wearable sensors has increased significantly in the last 20 years due to the relation between application-oriented scenarios (industrial sector, office scenarios, healthcare, sports and entertainment sector) and activities to recognise (ambulation, transportation, daily activities, exercise, military, upper body and recreation). Although, state-of-the-art systems for activity recognition present acceptable performance, advances in this area are mainly focused on identifying which activity is being performed. Thus, little work has been done on studying how well skilled or dextrous activity is  performed. Identifying how well these activities are performed is more challenging than identifying the action type itself. To this end, the study of human motion performance is not simply a matter of experts performing the actions in a more consistent manner than novices since the expert is able to produce different but contextually relevant actions in a manner that the novice is unable to perform. One approach to this problem involves viewing human motion in terms of nonlinear dynamical systems. The focus of this PhD is on recognising dexterity in dance, which is an application that is still poorly understood.

For this this talk, I consider state-of-the-art methods for skill assessment in different human activities. Then, for my current research methodology, I present a description of time-delay embedding and Principal Component Analysis to analyse data from body-worn inertial sensors mounted on dancers.  Preliminary results are presented from three male participants with different years of experiences in dancing salsa: expert (14 yr of experience), intermediate (4 yr of experience) and novice dancers. The talk concludes with potential uses of the time-delay embedding for Human Activity Recognition from wearable sensors data.

Preliminary results are presented from three male participants with different years of experiences in dancing salsa: expert (14 yr of experience), intermediate (4 yr of experience) and novice dancers. Additionally, areas of exploitation, conclusions and future work is presented.


EXTRA IDEA  

On the other hand, when the activity is performed poorly (opposite to the expert level of dexterity) no feedback is given to the user. We are therefore proposing the use of electrical muscle stimuli for presenting feedback to the users and improve their movements toward a better movement which by continuing training and feedback should be appear similar to the expert movement.



## OUTCOME

Unfortunately, this submission had not been accepted because of the limitation of space.
