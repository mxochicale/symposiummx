% The World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that people worldwide are living longer.
% In 2015, 125 million people worldwide were aged 80 years or older
% and by 2050 there will be almost 434 million people in this age group worldwide
% of which 80\% of all older people will live in low- and middle-income countries.
% Similarly, WHO highlighted that the improvement of methodologies for measurement, monitoring
% and understanding the elderly is a priority area of action.
% With this, it is believed that elderly care using robot is possible.
% For instance, (a) RI-MAN humanoid robot can carry patients and transport them,
% also has facial recognition and scent discerner; (b) RIBA-II humanoid robot can carry up to 80 kg;
% (b) Paro bot helps people with dementia to decrease stress or feelings of loneliness; and
% (d) Palro humanoid robot can be used in entertainment activities such as dancing or gaming.
% Recently, humanoid robots like Pepper and NAO have been used to understand human emotions
% or to perform therapies for rehabilitation with children or elderly people.
% For this talk, I will therefore present the  methodologies for measurement, monitoring and
% understanding Human-Robot Interaction with the use of wearable inertial sensors.
% I will also present some application scenarios where a group of people is interacting
% with NAO and show the remarkable capabilities of measuring human body movement as
% well as the peer-to-peer influence when receiving instructions from the NAO.
