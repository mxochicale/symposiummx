These are some personal comments that might be of help for the organisers of the
next symposium.


# Improve the quality of the submitted abstracts to the symposium

The organisers as well as the students should be a bit more rigorous about
the quality of both the abstracts and the presentations.
Personally, I was dissapointed that the panel of Computer Science and Robotics
were cancelled to which I was re-allocated to other room becuase of
the cancellation of some speakers. With this in mind, I am starting to think
that you can try to do some kind of peer-review submission where PhD students in
their third or four year can provide acute critics to improve the submitted work.
(I will happyly volunteer for future symposiums in my lines of research)


# Towards Open and Reproducible Science

I believe in the SCIENCE that you can replicate experiments, where data is
available to further experimentation, where you can cooperate with others.
Personally, I have been learning a
lot from open-source projects in [http://github.com/] and open science software
that runs in GNU-Linux. The general idea is that others can be get some benefits
of studing these open source projects that might results in the creation of
deeper questions and therefore make substancial advances in science.
For instance, regarding the open and reproducible science, we (Mexicans) can
adapt the model of ReScience peer-reviewed journal [http://rescience.github.io/]
which promotes open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be
replicated from its description.
I believe that by adapting the ReScience peer-reviewed journal model to the symposium
[(Rougier et al 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04393),
we can increase the scientific quality and promote a more cooperative science.





P.S Informaly, we were talking about the advantange of an Open and Reproducible
Science with Juan V. Hernández [https://github.com/Alymantara] who mentioned about some open projects
in the Netherlands, Lucía M Weinberg [https://twitter.com/luciamawe]
about the problems of data to reproduce results and Daniel Celis [https://github.com/dcelisgarza]
with his comments about the advange of using github.




# Program

When one is one a conference is very important to keep track of the speakers
as well and the talks, also to have notification(s) of possible changes in the
program like titles of the talks, speaker names or places and times.
So the advice here is to take advantage of the mobile apps that can be used
for the program of the symposium. For instance,
http://conf-app.com/ is doing a nice job for conference schedule,
read papers and abstracts or make some networking; it has a web version
https://chi2014.acm.org/program/mobile/.
This is the contact email confapp [at] googlegroups.com and the people behind
the app: ehayashi [at] cs.cmu.edu; soney [at] umich.edu; wiese [at] cs.utah.edu



# Giving feedback

I believe that the way to improve anything is by providing constructive feedback
(it is not only pointed out what it didn't work but how we can help to improve it)
so we have to be willing to cooperate so as to improve the symposium every year.
With this in mind, I am thinking that it would be nice
to have different options to provide feedback so for example:
(i) to have a box for feedback with some kind of feedback forms or
(ii) create a hashtag or a space in the website to submit the feecback.

To encourage the participants to fill the forms for feedback and
most importantly to keep them in the conference, the organisers can create some
kind of raffle with an attractive gift (maybe a Tequila!) which can be given
at the end of the conference. In general, people like free stuff.


# Using twitter

To make more echo around the world and certainly in Mexico about the Mexicans
doing science in the UK, it is highly recommended to use twitter so as to promote
their research, to do networking, to post sensitive questions, and to share
knowledge, ideas, experience and expertise.

It would be nice to have some kind of twitter wall in the symposium to display
all the discussions, talks, questions or photos regarding the given hash tag.

These are some references to create a twitter wall

# Create a protocol for chairing the talks

It might be useful to follow a certain kind of protocol when chairing the talks.
These are some ideas:
1. Read a short biography of the presenter.
2. Keep track of the time and show the presenter the "5 min to go" and
"2 min to go" notice before the end of the presentation.
3. Open the mic for questions and in case of no questions from the audience,
the chair should prepare some questions in advance.
4. Take photos to feed twitter with the user name, title and the hashtag for
the conference.

For those who are assigned to be chairs, the following sources are very useful
to make a more professional and engaging session.
