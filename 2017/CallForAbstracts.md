The Society of Mexican Students in the United Kingdom (MexSocUK) invites postgraduate researchers and early career researchers to present their work, engage in debate, and share their current research in a friendly and supportive environment.

The objective of this event is to bring together the Mexican student community in the UK, as well as students and academics interested in Mexican studies, across the following areas:

    Arts
    Health
    Humanities
    Science
    Social Science
    Technology
    Special panel on Energy

ORAL PRESENTATIONS

In an individual oral session, you are expected to present your own research in a lecture-style format (using visual aid like power point slides). These presentations will explain the general idea or results of your work (without technical details), in no more than 15 minutes. After your presentation the audience will have a 5 min Q&A. Please remember that you will be presenting your work to a general audience, so make sure each point is clear.

Title of Presentation: Towards the Analysis of Human Movement with Humanoid Robots

Abstract:  
The World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that people worldwide are living longer.
In 2015, 125 million people worldwide were aged 80 years or older
and by 2050 there will be almost 434 million people in this age group worldwide,
 of which 80 \% will live in low- and middle-income countries.
Similarly, WHO highlighted that the improvement of methodologies for measurement,
monitoring and understanding the elderly are a priority area of action.
With this in mind, we believe that we can address those areas of opportunity
where humanoids robots can be used for elderly care.
For instance, (a) RI-MAN and RIBA-II  humanoid robots
have facial recognition and a scent discerner with the ability to
carry patients up to 80 kg to different surrounding locations;
(b) Paro bot helps people with dementia to decrease stress or feelings of loneliness; and
(c) Palro humanoid robot can be used in entertainment activities such as dancing or gaming.
Recently, humanoid robots like Pepper and NAO have been used to understand
human emotions, or to perform therapies for rehabilitation with children or
elderly people.
In this talk, I will therefore present the  methodologies for measurement,
monitoring and understanding the Human-Robot Interaction with the use of wearable
inertial sensors.
I will also present some results of a group of persons interacting with NAO
to show the remarkable capabilities of measuring peer-to-peer influence when
receiving instructions from the NAO.
