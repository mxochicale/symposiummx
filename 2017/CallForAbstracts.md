ORAL PRESENTATIONS

In an individual oral session, you are expected to present your own research in a lecture-style format (using visual aid like power point slides). These presentations will explain the general idea or results of your work (without technical details), in no more than 15 minutes. After your presentation the audience will have a 5 min Q&A. Please remember that you will be presenting your work to a general audience, so make sure each point is clear.
